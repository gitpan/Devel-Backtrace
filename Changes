        Added Devel::DollarAt.
        Added skipmysubs to Devel::Backtrace and called_package to

0.07    Thu Mar 27 16:14:03 CET 2008
        Some minor changes (nothing in the code).

0.08    Sat Mar 29 18:43:42 CET 2008
        Added some documentation fixes.
        Previously, some tests were skipped in perl 5.6.  I made them work in
        5.6 and don't skip them any more.
        Previously, a test failed in 5.10 because perl 5.8 and 5.10 sometimes
        generate different line numbers in error messages.  I made the test
        work (see examples/dollarat.pl).

0.09    Sun Mar 30 16:08:25 CEST 2008
        Documentation fixes
        Added version to Devel::Backtrace::Point

0.10    Wed Apr  2 02:51:43 CEST 2008
        Format strings for stringification.
        Level information in Devel::Backtrace::Point.
        Fix a warning in examples/dollarat.pl in perl 5.10.
        Change the test system.  Previously it used to automatically run the
        examples, but now it's independent from the examples because that's
        more flexible.
        Again, added some fixes to make the tests work on all platforms.
